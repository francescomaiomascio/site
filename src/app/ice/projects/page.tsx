      <h1>ICE Lab</h1>

      <p>
        ICE Lab is a research and engineering laboratory focused on the design of
        integrated cognitive systems. The project explores how runtime engines,
        environments, protocols, and networks can be composed into a coherent,
        modular ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p>
        ICE is not a single product, but a family of tightly related systems that
        share common architectural principles and a unified cognitive model.
      </p>

      <h2>Core Domains</h2>

      <h3>ICE Studio</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Integrated Cognitive Environment.</strong> ICE Studio is the
        primary user-facing environment. It provides the graphical interface,
        workflow orchestration, project management, and interaction layer
        through which users operate the ICE ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p>
        ICE Studio focuses on usability, workflows, and human–system interaction.
        It acts as the entry point to the underlying cognitive runtime.
      </p>

      <h3>ICE Engine</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Integrated Cognitive Engine.</strong> ICE Engine represents the
        core runtime responsible for orchestration, lifecycle management,
        execution control, and system coordination.
      </p>

      <p>
        The engine is designed to be modular, extensible, and capable of running
        both locally and in distributed environments.
      </p>

      <h3>ICE AI</h3>
      <p>
        ICE AI groups all components related to cognition: agents, language
        models, embeddings, knowledge processing, and reasoning pipelines.
      </p>

      <p>
        This domain defines how intelligent behaviors are composed, coordinated,
        and executed within the ICE ecosystem.
      </p>

      <h3>ICEP</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Integrated Cognitive Engine Protocol.</strong> ICEP defines the
        communication and control protocol used by ICE components to discover,
        pair, negotiate capabilities, and exchange runtime information.
      </p>

      <p>
        ICEP is designed to be transport-agnostic and usable in both local and
        remote scenarios.
      </p>

      <h3>ICENet</h3>
      <p>
        ICENet represents the network layer built on top of ICEP. It provides
        discovery, pairing, topology management, and secure communication between
        ICE nodes.
      </p>

      <p>
        ICENet enables distributed ICE deployments while preserving local-first
        principles.
      </p>

      <h2>Project Status</h2>

      <p>
        The ICE ecosystem is currently in a <strong>foundational / pre-MVP</strong>{" "}
        phase. Architecture, lifecycle, and core abstractions are being
        stabilized before formal modular separation and public releases.
      </p>

      <p>
        Current development focuses on achieving a functional, end-to-end system
        before extracting individual domains into standalone modules.
