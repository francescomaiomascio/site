## Relationship to ICE

The ICE ecosystem is one of the major bodies of work presented on this site.

ICE content appears here as:
- documentation
- architectural overviews
- project navigation
- public explanations

This repository does **not** define, constrain, or govern ICE.

ICE remains defined exclusively by its own repositories
(e.g. ICE Foundation, Runtime, Engine).

This site acts only as an **interface and communication layer**.
