This repository contains the **public website** for the ICE ecosystem and the
personal web presence of **Francesco Maiomascio**.

It serves as the main external entry point for:
- ICE vision and system overview
- Project status and documentation access
- Public-facing presentation of ongoing work

The site is built with **Next.js** and deployed via **Cloudflare Pages**.

---

## Role of this Repository

This repository is intentionally **not an application** and not part of the ICE
runtime or execution stack.

Its role is to:

- Provide a stable public-facing surface for ICE
- Act as a navigational hub to ICE projects and documentation
- Present a coherent identity across systems, research, and tooling
- Evolve independently from ICE internal repositories

The website is treated as an **interface**, not as a product.

---

## Structure Overview

At a high level, the site is organized around two layers:

- **Personal / Profile layer**  
  Presentation of the author, background, and systems thinking approach.

- **ICE layer**  
  Public-facing pages dedicated to the ICE ecosystem:
  concepts, projects, documentation links, and status.

This separation is intentional and reflected in routing and layout.

---

## Design Philosophy

The website follows these principles:

- Clarity over decoration  
- Structure before aesthetics  
- Navigation before content volume  
- Long-term coherence over short-term polish  

Visual design, layout, and content are expected to **iterate continuously**
as the ICE ecosystem evolves.

---

## Technology

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Deployment:** Cloudflare Pages
- **Styling:** Shared ICE theme assets (via submodule)
- **Rendering:** Static export for maximum reliability and portability

No backend services or runtime logic are hosted here.

---

## Status

The website is **active and evolving**.

Content, layout, and structure will change as:
- ICE components mature
- Documentation stabilizes
- Public communication needs grow

Breaking changes to structure are acceptable.

---

## Related Projects

- ICE Core repositories
- ICE Documentation
- ICE Studio (future)

Links are intentionally centralized here.
