        <p>
          I design and engineer <strong>runtime-centric cognitive systems</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am not primarily interested in models, prompts, or isolated AI
          capabilities. I am interested in <strong>how intelligent systems
          execute</strong>, how they are constrained, how they evolve over time,
          and how their effects can be observed, audited, and governed.
        </p>

        <p>
          For me, intelligence is not an emergent property to be admired.
          It is a <strong>process to be controlled</strong>.

        <h2>Why this work exists</h2>

        <p>
          Most contemporary AI systems operate without a clear notion of authority.
        </p>

        <p>
          Models decide. Side effects happen. State mutates. Memory accumulates.
        </p>

        <p>
          But no component is truly responsible for <em>why</em> something was
          allowed to happen.
        </p>

        <p>
          If intelligence is becoming infrastructural, then
          <strong> execution must be sovereign</strong>.

      {/* FOCUS */}
      <Section id="focus" width="narrow">
        <h2>Research focus</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>execution is explicit and governed</li>
          <li>state is derived, never mutated implicitly</li>
          <li>side effects are capability-gated and traceable</li>
          <li>memory is an artifact, not an accident</li>
          <li>long-running processes remain intelligible over time</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I approach this as <strong>systems research</strong>, not product
          development.

        <h2>ICE Lab</h2>

        <p>
          ICE is a runtime architecture research effort.
          Not a framework. Not a model.
        </p>

        <p>
          A <strong>kernel-like execution environment</strong> for cognitive systems.
